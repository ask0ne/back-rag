# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Guide

## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

## Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving accuracy over time.

### Types of Machine Learning

#### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

Common algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

Applications:
