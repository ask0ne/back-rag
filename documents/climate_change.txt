# Climate Change and Environmental Science

## Understanding Climate Change

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global or regional climate patterns, primarily attributed to increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities since the mid-20th century.

## Scientific Evidence

### Temperature Records
Global average temperatures have risen by approximately 1.1°C (2°F) since the late 19th century, with the most dramatic warming occurring in the past 40 years.

### Ice and Snow
- Arctic sea ice is declining at a rate of 13% per decade
- The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are losing mass
- Glaciers are retreating worldwide
- Snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere is decreasing

### Ocean Changes
- Ocean temperatures are rising
- Sea levels have risen 8-9 inches since 1880
- Ocean acidity has increased by 30% since the Industrial Revolution

### Extreme Weather
Increased frequency and intensity of:
- Heat waves
- Droughts
- Heavy precipitation events
- Tropical cyclones

## Causes of Climate Change

### Greenhouse Gases
**Primary greenhouse gases:**
- Carbon dioxide (CO2) - 76% of emissions
- Methane (CH4) - 16% of emissions
- Nitrous oxide (N2O) - 6% of emissions
- Fluorinated gases - 2% of emissions

### Human Activities
**Major sources of greenhouse gas emissions:**
- Fossil fuel combustion (electricity, heat, transportation)
- Agriculture and land use changes
- Industrial processes
- Waste management
